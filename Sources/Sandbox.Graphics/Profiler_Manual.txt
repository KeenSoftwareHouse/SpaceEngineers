Profiler usage:
To enable/disable the profiler, open MyCompilationSymbols.cs in Vrage, and enable PerformanceProfiling and ProfileFromStart.

Profiler Keybindings
It is not immediately apparent what all the possible controls are for the profiler, so here they are, organized by group.

Key combination                                        Functionality
Profiler management
Alt + numpad ,                                         Opens/closes the profiler, doesn't reset the current profiler stack
Alt + numpad enter                                     Pause/unpause profiler
Alt + Ctrl + Insert                                    Reset profiler data

Alt + numpad /                                         Decreases the level limit
Alt + numpad *                                         Increases the level limit
Alt + Ctrl + numpad /                                  Decreases the level limit by 1
Alt + Ctrl + numpad *                                  Increases the level limit by 1

Profiler navigation
Alt + numpad 0                                         Go back 1 block (will open the profiler if it is closed, this is done for backwards compatibility with programmer muscle memory)
Alt + numpad 1-9                                       Enter the next profiler block as usual
Alt + Ctrl + numpad 1-9                                Select block 10-19
Alt + Ctrl + Space + numpad 1-9                        Select block 20-29

Alt + Shift + /                                        Copy current profiler path to clipboard
Alt + Shift + *                                        Try to navigate to the profiler path from the clipboard

Profiler display settings
Alt + Home                                             Increase profiler scale
Alt + End                                              Decrease profiler scale
Alt + Insert                                           Change profiler sorting order
Alt + Ctrl + numpad +                                  Increase local area (Used for calculating the average milliseconds)
Alt + Ctrl + numpad -                                  Decrease local area (Used for calculating the average milliseconds)

Profiler frame selection
Alt + PageUp                                           Go forward through frames
Alt + PageDown                                         Go backwards through frames
Alt + Ctrl + PageUp                                    Go forward through frames by 1 frame
Alt + Ctrl + PageDown                                  Go backwards through frames by 1 frame
Alt + Shift + PageUp                                   Fast forward through frames
Alt + Shift + PageDown                                 Fast backwards through frames
Alt + Ctrl + End                                       Disable selection mode

Generally interesting paths:
UpdateInternal::Update > Update > Session.Update > Before simulation > MySector > MyEntities.UpdateBeforeSimulation
UpdateInternal::Update > Update > Session.Update > After simulation > MySector > UpdateAfterSimulation
These two paths will generally show you the updated elements in a given world. Useful for when you are trying to profile the world.

You can use these paths by copying them in your browser, then opening the profiler and pressing Alt + Shift + *.
