            <p>A buffer interface accesses a buffer resource, which is unstructured memory. Buffers typically store vertex or index data.</p>	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>There are three types of buffers: vertex, index, or a shader-constant buffer. Create a buffer resource by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateBuffer(SharpDX.Direct3D11.BufferDescription@,System.Nullable{SharpDX.DataBox},SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer)"/></strong>.</p><p>A buffer must be bound to the pipeline before it can be accessed. Buffers can be bound to the input-assembler stage by calls to <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.InputAssemblerStage.SetVertexBuffers(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.VertexBufferBinding)"/></strong> and <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.InputAssemblerStage.SetIndexBuffer(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer,SharpDX.DXGI.Format,System.Int32)"/></strong>, to the stream-output stage by a call to <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.StreamOutputStage.SetTargets(System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer[],System.Int32[])"/></strong>, and to a shader stage by calling the appropriate shader method (such as <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VertexShaderStage.SetConstantBuffers(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong> for example).</p><p>Buffers can be bound to multiple pipeline stages simultaneously for reading. A buffer can also be bound to a single pipeline stage for writing; however, the same buffer cannot be bound for reading and writing simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <p>Resource priorities determine which resource to evict from video memory when the system has run out of video memory. The resource will not be lost; it will be removed from video memory and placed into system memory, or possibly placed onto the hard drive. The resource will be loaded back into video memory when it is required.</p><p>A resource that is set to the maximum priority, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResourcePriority.Maximum"/>, is only evicted if there is no other way of resolving the incoming memory request. The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) tries to split an incoming memory request to its minimum size and evict lower-priority resources before evicting a resource with maximum priority.</p><p>Changing the priorities of resources should be done carefully. The wrong eviction priorities could be a detriment to performance rather than an improvement. </p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            This method returns a reference to the resource we are gaining access to.
            </returns>
            <remarks>
            To share a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the resource must have been created with the  <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Shared"/> flag, if it was created using the ID3D10Device interface.  If it was created using the IDXGIDevice interface, then the resource is always shared. The REFIID, or GUID, of the interface to the resource can be obtained by using the __uuidof() macro.  For example, __uuidof(ID3D10Buffer) will get the GUID of the interface to a buffer resource. When sharing a resource between two Direct3D 10 devices the unique handle of the resource can be obtained by querying the resource for the <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Resource"/> interface and then calling {{GetSharedHandle}}.
            <code> IDXGIResource* pOtherResource(NULL);
            hr = pOtherDeviceResource-&gt;QueryInterface( __uuidof(IDXGIResource), (void**)&amp;pOtherResource );
            HANDLE sharedHandle;
            pOtherResource-&gt;GetSharedHandle(&amp;sharedHandle); </code>
            The only resources that can be shared are 2D non-mipmapped textures. To share a resource between a Direct3D 9 device and a Direct3D 10 device the texture must have been created using  the pSharedHandle argument of {{CreateTexture}}.   The shared Direct3D 9 handle is then passed to OpenSharedResource in the hResource argument. The following code illustrates the method calls involved.
            <code> sharedHandle = NULL; // must be set to NULL to create, can use a valid handle here to open in D3D9
            pDevice9-&gt;CreateTexture(..., pTex2D_9, &amp;sharedHandle);
            ...
            pDevice10-&gt;OpenSharedResource(sharedHandle, __uuidof(ID3D10Resource), (void**)(&amp;tempResource10));
            tempResource10-&gt;QueryInterface(__uuidof(ID3D10Texture2D), (void**)(&amp;pTex2D_10));
            tempResource10-&gt;Release();
            // now use pTex2D_10 with pDevice10    </code>
            Textures being shared from D3D9 to D3D10 have the following restrictions.  Textures must be 2D Only 1 mip level is allowed Texture must have default usage Texture must be write only MSAA textures are not allowed Bind flags must have SHADER_RESOURCE and RENDER_TARGET set Only R10G10B10A2_UNORM, R16G16B16A16_FLOAT and R8G8B8A8_UNORM formats are allowed  If a shared texture is updated on one device <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.Flush"/> must be called on that device.

            <p>A resource is made up of one or more subresources; a view identifies which subresources to allow the pipeline to access. In addition, each resource is bound to the pipeline using a view. A shader-resource view is designed to bind any buffer or texture resource to the shader stages using the following  API methods: <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong>, <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong> and <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong>.</p><p>Because a view is fully typed, this means that typeless resources become fully typed when bound to the pipeline.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??To successfully create a shader-resource view from a typeless buffer (for example, <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Typeless"/></strong>), you must set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.BufferAllowRawViews"/></strong> flag when you create the buffer.</p><p>The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows?8, allows you to use <strong>CreateShaderResourceView</strong> for the following new purpose. </p><p>You can create shader-resource views of video resources so that Direct3D shaders can process those shader-resource views. These video resources are either Texture2D or Texture2DArray. The value in the <strong>ViewDimension</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription"/></strong> structure for a created shader-resource view must match the type of video resource, D3D11_SRV_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2D          for Texture2D and D3D11_SRV_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2DARRAY for Texture2DArray.

This can simplify the creation of input-layout objects when you are working with many shaders with identical inputs.</p><p>If a data type in the input-layout declaration does not match the data type in a shader-input signature, CreateInputLayout will generate a warning during compilation. The warning is simply to call attention to the fact that the data may be reinterpreted when read from a register. You may either disregard this warning (if reinterpretation is intentional) or make the data types match in both declarations to eliminate the warning.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>When multisampling a texture, the number of quality levels available for an adapter is dependent on the texture format used and the number of  samples requested. The maximum number of quality levels is defined by <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.MultisampleCountMaximum"/> in D3D11.h. If this method returns 0, the format  and sample count combination is not supported for the installed adapter.</p><p>Furthermore, the definition of a quality level is up to each hardware vendor to define, however no facility is provided by Direct3D to help discover  this information.</p><p>Note that FEATURE_LEVEL_10_1 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all render targets except R32G32B32A32 and R32G32B32. FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0 devices are required to support 4x MSAA for all render target formats, and 8x MSAA for all render target formats  except R32G32B32A32 formats.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <p>Set an exception-mode flag to elevate an error condition to a non-continuable exception. </p><p>Whenever an error occurs, a Direct3D device enters the DEVICEREMOVED state and if the appropriate exception flag has been set, an exception is raised. A raised exception is designed to terminate an application. Before termination, the last chance an application has to persist data is by using an UnhandledExceptionFilter (see Structured Exception Handling). In general, UnhandledExceptionFilters are leveraged to try to persist data when an application is crashing (to disk, for example). Any code that executes during an UnhandledExceptionFilter is not guaranteed to reliably execute (due to possible process corruption). Any data that the UnhandledExceptionFilter manages to persist, before the UnhandledExceptionFilter crashes again, should be treated as suspect, and therefore inspected by a new, non-corrupted process to see if it is usable.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

The resulting value specifies how to create the context state object. The <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags.Singlethreaded"/> flag is currently the only defined flag. If the original device was created with <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.SingleThreaded"/>, you must create all context state objects from that device with the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags.Singlethreaded"/> flag. </para> <para>The context state object that  CreateDeviceContextState creates  inherits the threading model of its associated device context. By default the context state object is rent-threaded, so that an application synchronizes access to the device context, typically by use of critical sections. In contrast, the context state object is free-threaded if you used the ID3D10Multithread interface to turn on thread protection for the device context.</para> <para>If you set the single-threaded flag for both the context state object and the device, you guarantee that you will   call the whole set of context methods and device methods only from one thread.

            <param name="featureLevelsRef"><para>A reference to an array of <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel"/> values.

            <returns>A <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState"/> object that represents the state of a Direct3D device.</returns>	
            <remarks>	
            The  REFIID value of the emulated interface is a <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> obtained by use of the __uuidof operator. For example, __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>) gets the <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> of the interface to a Microsoft Direct3D?11 device.Call the <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext1.SwapDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState@)"/> method to activate the context state object. When the context state object is active, the device behaviors that are associated with both the context state object's feature level and its compatible interface are activated on the Direct3D device until the next call to SwapDeviceContextState.When a context state object is active, the runtime disables certain methods on the device and context interfaces. For example, a context state object that is created with __uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>) will cause the runtime to turn off most of the Microsoft Direct3D?10 device interfaces, and a context state object that is created with __uuidof(<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1"/>) or __uuidof(<see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device"/>) will cause the runtime to turn off most of the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/> methods.	
            This behavior ensures that a user of either emulated interface cannot set device state that the other emulated interface is unable to express. This restriction helps guarantee that the <see cref="!:SharpDX.Direct3D10.Device1"/> emulated interface accurately reflects the full state of the pipeline and that the emulated interface will not operate contrary to its original interface definition.For example, suppose the tessellation stage is made active through the <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/> interface	
            when you create the device through <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/> or D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain,  instead of through the Direct3D?10 equivalents. Because  the Direct3D?11 context is active, a Direct3D?10 interface is inactive when you first retrieve it via QueryInterface. This means that you cannot  immediately pass a Direct3D?10 interface that you retrieved from a Direct3D?11 device to a function. You must first call SwapDeviceContextState to activate a Direct3D?10-compatible context state object.The following table shows the methods that are active and inactive for each emulated interface.Emulated interface Active device or immediate context  interfaces Inactive device or immediate context  interfaces  <para> <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/> or</para>

            <p>A deferred context is a thread-safe context that you can use to record graphics commands on a thread other than the main rendering thread.  By using a deferred context, you can record graphics commands into a command list that is encapsulated by the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList"/></strong> interface.  After you record all scene items, you can then submit them to the main render thread for final rendering.  In this manner, you can perform rendering tasks concurrently across multiple threads and potentially improve performance in multi-core CPU scenarios.</p><p>You can create multiple deferred contexts.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??If you use the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.SingleThreaded"/></strong> value to create the device that is represented by <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1"/></strong>, the <strong>CreateDeferredContext1</strong> method will fail, and you will not be able to create a deferred context.</p><p>For more information about deferred contexts, see Immediate and Deferred Rendering.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>The  <strong>REFIID</strong> value of the emulated interface is a <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> obtained by use of the <strong>__uuidof</strong> operator. For example, <code>__uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>)</code> gets the <see cref="T:System.Guid"/> of the interface to a Microsoft Direct3D?11 device.</p><p>Call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext1.SwapDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState@)"/></strong> method to activate the context state object. When the context state object is active, the device behaviors that are associated with both the context state object's feature level and its compatible interface are activated on the Direct3D device until the next call to <strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong>. </p><p>When a context state object is active, the runtime disables certain methods on the device and context interfaces. For example, a context state object that is created with <code>__uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>)</code> will cause the runtime to turn off most of the Microsoft Direct3D?10 device interfaces, and a context state object that is created with <code>__uuidof(ID3D10Device1)</code> or <code>__uuidof(ID3D10Device)</code> will cause the runtime to turn off most of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/></strong> methods.	
            This behavior ensures that a user of either emulated interface cannot set device state that the other emulated interface is unable to express. This restriction helps guarantee that the <strong>ID3D10Device1</strong> emulated interface accurately reflects the full state of the pipeline and that the emulated interface will not operate contrary to its original interface definition. </p><p>For example, suppose the tessellation stage is made active through the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/></strong> interface	
            when you create the device through <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/></strong> or <strong>D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain</strong>,  instead of through the Direct3D?10 equivalents. Because  the Direct3D?11 context is active, a Direct3D?10 interface is inactive when you first retrieve it via <strong>QueryInterface</strong>. This means that you cannot  immediately pass a Direct3D?10 interface that you retrieved from a Direct3D?11 device to a function. You must first call <strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> to activate a Direct3D?10-compatible context state object.	
            </p><p>The following table shows the methods that are active and inactive for each emulated interface.</p><table> <tr><th> Emulated interface </th><th>Active device or immediate context  interfaces </th><th>Inactive device or immediate context  interfaces</th></tr> <tr><td> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/></strong> or</p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1"/></strong> </p> </td><td> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/></strong> </p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device"/></strong> +</p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device1"/></strong> +</p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device2"/></strong> </p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D.DeviceMultithread"/></strong> </p> </td><td> <strong>ID3D10Device</strong> </td></tr> <tr><td> <p> <strong>ID3D10Device1</strong> or</p> <p> <strong>ID3D10Device</strong> </p> </td><td> <p> <strong>ID3D10Device</strong> </p> <p> <strong>ID3D10Device1</strong> </p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device"/></strong> +</p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.Device1"/></strong> </p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D.DeviceMultithread"/></strong> </p> </td><td> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/></strong> </p> <p> <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/></strong> (As published by the immediate context.

            <p>A deferred context is a thread-safe context that you can use to record graphics commands on a thread other than the main rendering thread.  By using a deferred context, you can record graphics commands into a command list that is encapsulated by the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.CommandList"/></strong> interface.  After you record all scene items, you can then submit them to the main render thread for final rendering.  In this manner, you can perform rendering tasks concurrently across multiple threads and potentially improve performance in multi-core CPU scenarios.</p><p>You can create multiple deferred contexts.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??If you use the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.SingleThreaded"/></strong> value to create the device, <strong>CreateDeferredContext2</strong> fails with <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.ResultCode.InvalidCall"/></strong>, and you can't create a deferred context.</p><p>For more information about deferred contexts, see Immediate and Deferred Rendering.</p>

            <remarks>	
            This method is unusual in that it causes the GPU to perform the copy operation (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a result, it has a few restrictions designed for improving performance. For instance, the source and destination resources:  Must be different resources. Must be the same type. Must have identical dimensions (including width, height, depth, and size as appropriate). Will only be copied. CopyResource does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. Must have compatible DXGI formats, which means the formats must be identical or at least from the same type group. For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. Might not be currently mapped.  You cannot use an {{Immutable}} resource as a destination. You can use a   {{depth-stencil}} resource as either a source or a destination.  Resources created with multisampling capability (see <see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/>) can be used as source and destination only if both source and destination have identical multisampled count and quality. If source and destination differ in multisampled count and quality or if one is multisampled and the other is not multisampled the call to ID3D11DeviceContext::CopyResource fails. The method is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue. This attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data.  An application that only needs to copy a portion of the data in a resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/> instead.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            The source box must be within the size of the source resource. The destination offsets, (x, y, and z) allow the source box to be offset when writing into the destination resource; however, the dimensions of the source box and the offsets must be within the size of the resource. If the resources are buffers, all coordinates are in bytes; if the resources are textures, all coordinates are in texels. {{D3D11CalcSubresource}} is a helper function for calculating subresource indexes. CopySubresourceRegion performs the copy on the GPU (similar to a memcpy by the CPU). As a consequence, the source and destination resources:  Must be different subresources (although they can be from the same resource). Must be the same type. Must have compatible DXGI formats (identical or from the same type group). For example, a DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_FLOAT texture can be copied to an DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_UINT texture since both of these formats are in the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32_TYPELESS group. May not be currently mapped.  CopySubresourceRegion only supports copy; it does not support any stretch, color key, blend, or format conversions. An application that needs to copy an entire resource should use <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopyResource_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource)"/> instead. CopySubresourceRegion is an asynchronous call which may be added to the command-buffer queue, this attempts to remove pipeline stalls that may occur when copying data. See performance considerations for more details. Note??If you use CopySubresourceRegion with a depth-stencil buffer or a multisampled resource, you must copy the whole subresource. In this situation, you must pass 0 to the DstX, DstY, and DstZ parameters and NULL to the pSrcBox parameter. In addition, source and destination resources, which are represented by the pSrcResource and pDstResource parameters, should have identical sample count values. Example The following code snippet copies a box (located at (120,100),(200,220)) from a source texture into a region (10,20),(90,140) in a destination texture. 	
            <code> D3D11_BOX sourceRegion;	
            sourceRegion.left = 120;	
            sourceRegion.right = 200;	
            sourceRegion.top = 100;	
            sourceRegion.bottom = 220;	
            sourceRegion.front = 0;	
            sourceRegion.back = 1; pd3dDeviceContext-&gt;CopySubresourceRegion( pDestTexture, 0, 10, 20, 0, pSourceTexture, 0, &amp;sourceRegion ); </code>	
            	
             Notice, that for a 2D texture, front and back are set to 0 and 1 respectively.

            <remarks>	
            This API is most useful when re-using the resulting render target of one render pass as an input to a second render pass. The source and destination resources must be the same resource type and have the same dimensions. In addition, they must have compatible formats. There are three scenarios for this:  ScenarioRequirements Source and destination are prestructured and typedBoth the source and destination must have identical formats and that format must be specified in the Format parameter. One resource is prestructured and typed and the other is prestructured and typelessThe typed resource must have a format that is compatible with the typeless resource (i.e. the typed resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT and the typeless resource is DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS). The format of the typed resource must be specified in the Format parameter. Source and destination are prestructured and typelessBoth the source and destination must have the same typeless format (i.e. both must have DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS), and the Format parameter must specify a format that is compatible with the source and destination (i.e. if both are DXGI_FORMAT_R32_TYPELESS then DXGI_FORMAT_R32_FLOAT could be specified in the Format parameter). For example, given the DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_TYPELESS format:  The source (or dest) format could be DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_UNORM The dest (or source) format could be DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_FLOAT    ?

Other <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode"/></strong>-typed values are not supported for a deferred context.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows?8, enables  mapping dynamic constant buffers and shader resource views (SRVs) of dynamic buffers with <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/></strong>.  The Direct3D 11 and earlier runtimes limited mapping to vertex or index buffers. To determine if a Direct3D device supports these features, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CheckFeatureSupport(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Feature)"/></strong> with <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Feature.D3D11Options"/></strong>. <strong>CheckFeatureSupport</strong> fills members of a <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.FeatureDataD3D11Options"/></strong> structure with the device's features. The relevant members here are <strong>MapNoOverwriteOnDynamicConstantBuffer</strong> and <strong>MapNoOverwriteOnDynamicBufferSRV</strong>.</p><p>For info about how to use <strong>Map</strong>, see How to: Use dynamic resources. </p>

            <p>The predicate must be in the "issued" or "signaled" state to be used for predication.

            <p>A draw API submits work to the rendering pipeline. This API submits work of an unknown size that was processed by the input assembler, vertex shader, and stream-output stages;  the work may or may not have gone through the geometry-shader stage.</p><p>After data has been streamed out to stream-output stage buffers, those buffers can be again bound to the Input Assembler stage at input slot 0 and DrawAuto will draw them without the application needing to know the amount of data that was written to the buffers. A measurement of the amount of data written to the SO stage buffers is maintained internally when the data is streamed out. This means that the CPU does not need to fetch the measurement before re-binding the data that was streamed as input data. Although this amount is tracked internally, it is still the responsibility of applications to use input layouts to describe the format of the data in the SO stage buffers so that the layouts are available when the buffers are again bound to the input assembler.</p><p>The following diagram shows the DrawAuto process.</p><p></p><p>Calling DrawAuto does not change the state of the streaming-output buffers that were bound again as inputs.</p><p>DrawAuto only works when drawing with one input buffer bound as an input to the IA stage at slot 0. Applications must create the SO buffer resource with both binding flags, <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.VertexBuffer"/></strong> and <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.StreamOutput"/></strong>.</p><p>This API does not support indexing or instancing.</p><p>If an application needs to retrieve the size of the streaming-output buffer, it can query for statistics on streaming output by using <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType.StreamOutputStatistics"/></strong>.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <p>For a shader-constant buffer; set <em>pDstBox</em> to <strong><c>null</c></strong>. It is not possible to use this method to partially update a shader-constant buffer.</p><p>A resource cannot be used as a destination if:</p><ul> <li>the resource is created with <strong>immutable</strong> or <strong>dynamic</strong> usage.</li> <li>the resource is created as a depth-stencil resource.</li> <li>the resource is created with multisampling capability (see <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/></strong>).</li> </ul><p>When <strong>UpdateSubresource</strong> returns, the application is free to change or even free the data pointed to by <em>pSrcData</em> because the method has already copied/snapped away the original contents.</p><p>The performance of <strong>UpdateSubresource</strong> depends on whether or not there is contention for the destination resource. For example, contention for a vertex buffer resource occurs when the application executes a <strong>Draw</strong> call and later calls <strong>UpdateSubresource</strong> on the same vertex buffer before the <strong>Draw</strong> call is actually executed by the GPU.</p><ul> <li>When there is contention for the resource, <strong>UpdateSubresource</strong> will perform 2 copies of the source data. First, the data is copied by the CPU to a temporary storage space accessible by the command buffer. This copy happens before the method returns.  A second copy is then performed by the GPU to copy the source data into non-mappable memory. This second copy happens asynchronously because it is executed by GPU when the command buffer is flushed.</li> <li>When there is no resource contention, the behavior of <strong>UpdateSubresource</strong> is dependent on which is faster (from the CPU's perspective): copying the data to the command buffer and then having a second copy execute when the command buffer is flushed, or having the CPU copy the data to the final resource location. This is dependent on the architecture of the underlying system.</li> </ul><p><strong>Note</strong>??<strong>Applies only to feature level 9_x hardware</strong> If you use <strong>UpdateSubresource</strong> or <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.CopySubresourceRegion_(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Int32,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion})"/></strong> to copy from a staging resource to a default resource, you can corrupt the destination contents. This occurs if you pass a <strong><c>null</c></strong> source box and if the source resource has different dimensions from those of the destination resource or if you use destination offsets, (x, y, and z). In this situation, always pass a source box that is the full size of the source resource.</p><p>To better understand the source row pitch and source depth pitch parameters, the following illustration shows a 3D volume texture.</p><p></p><p>Each block in this visual represents an element of data, and the size of each element is dependent on the resource's format. For example, if the resource format is <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Float"/>, the size of each element would be 128 bits, or 16 bytes. This 3D volume texture has a width of two, a height of three, and a depth of four.</p><p>To calculate the source row pitch and source depth pitch for a given resource, use the following formulas:</p><ul> <li>Source Row Pitch = [size of one element in bytes] * [number of elements in one row]</li> <li>Source Depth Pitch = [Source Row Pitch] * [number of rows (height)]</li> </ul><p>In the case of this example 3D volume texture where the size of each element is 16 bytes, the formulas are as follows:</p><ul> <li>Source Row Pitch = 16 * 2 = 32</li> <li>Source Depth Pitch = 16 * 2 * 3 = 96</li> </ul><p>The following illustration shows the resource as it is laid out in memory.</p><p></p><p>For example, the following code snippet shows how to specify a destination region in a 2D texture. Assume the destination texture is 512x512 and the operation will copy the data pointed to by <em>pData</em> to  [(120,100)..(200,220)] in the destination texture. Also assume that <em>rowPitch</em> has been initialized with the proper value (as explained above). <strong>front</strong> and <strong>back</strong> are set to 0 and 1 respectively, because by having <strong>front</strong> equal to <strong>back</strong>, the box is technically empty.</p><pre> <see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceRegion"/> destRegion;

A call to <strong>ExecuteCommandList</strong> of a command list from a deferred context onto another deferred context can be used to merge recorded lists. But to run the commands from the merged deferred command list on the GPU, you need to execute them on the immediate context. </p><p>This method performs some runtime validation related to queries. Queries that are begun in a device context cannot be manipulated indirectly by executing a command list (that is, Begin or End was invoked against the same query by the deferred context which generated the command list). If such a condition occurs, the ExecuteCommandList method does not execute the command list. However, the state of the device context is still maintained, as would be expected (<strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState"/></strong> is performed, unless the application indicates to preserve the device context state).</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>Most applications don't need to call this method. If an application calls this method when not necessary, it incurs a performance penalty.  Each call to <strong>Flush</strong> incurs a significant amount of overhead.</p><p>When Microsoft Direct3D state-setting, present, or draw commands are called by an application, those commands are queued into an internal command buffer.  <strong>Flush</strong> sends those commands to the GPU for processing. Typically, the Direct3D runtime sends these commands to the GPU automatically whenever the runtime determines that  they need to be sent, such as when the command buffer is full or when an application maps a resource. <strong>Flush</strong> sends the commands manually.</p><p>We recommend that you use <strong>Flush</strong> when the CPU waits for an arbitrary amount of time (such as when  you call the <strong>Sleep</strong> function).</p><p>Because <strong>Flush</strong> operates asynchronously,  it can return either before or after the GPU finishes executing the queued graphics commands. However, the graphics commands eventually always complete. You can call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateQuery(SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryDescription,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Query)"/></strong> method with the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.QueryType.Event"/></strong> value to create an event query; you can then use that event query in a call to the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.GetDataInternal(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Asynchronous,System.IntPtr,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.AsynchronousFlags)"/></strong> method to determine when the GPU is finished processing the graphics commands.	
            </p><p>Microsoft Direct3D?11 defers the destruction of objects. Therefore, an application can't rely upon objects immediately being destroyed. By calling <strong>Flush</strong>, you destroy any  objects whose destruction was deferred.  If an application requires synchronous destruction of an object, we recommend that the application release all its references, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext.ClearState"/></strong>, and then call <strong>Flush</strong>.</p>

This occurs if you pass a <strong><c>null</c></strong> source box and if the source resource has different dimensions from those of the destination resource or if you use destination offsets, (x, y, and z). In this situation, always pass a source box that is the full size of the source resource.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <p>If you call <strong>UpdateSubresource1</strong> to update a constant buffer, pass any region, and the driver has not been implemented to Windows?8, the runtime drops the call (except feature level 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 where the runtime emulates support).  The runtime also drops the call if you update a constant buffer with a partial region whose extent is not aligned to 16-byte granularity (16 bytes being a full constant). When the runtime drops the call, the runtime doesn't call the corresponding device driver interface (DDI).</p><p>When you record a call to <strong>UpdateSubresource</strong> with an offset <em>pDstBox</em> in a software command list, the offset in <em>pDstBox</em> is incorrectly applied to <em>pSrcData</em> when you play back the command list.

            <remarks>	
            <p><strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> changes device behavior. This device behavior depends on the emulated interface that you passed to the <em>EmulatedInterface</em> parameter of the  <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.CreateDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState)"/></strong> method when you created the context state object. </p><p><strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> is not supported on a deferred context.</p><p><strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> disables the incompatible device interfaces <strong>ID3D10Device</strong>, <strong>ID3D10Device1</strong>, <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/></strong>, and <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1"/></strong>. When a context state object is active, the runtime disables certain methods on the device and context interfaces. A context state object that is created with <code>__uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1"/>)</code> or <code>__uuidof(<see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/>)</code> turns off most of the Direct3D?10 device interfaces. A context state object that is created with <code>__uuidof(ID3D10Device1)</code> or <code>__uuidof(ID3D10Device)</code> turns off most of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/></strong> methods.	
            For more information about this behavior, see <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.CreateDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState)"/></strong>.</p><p><strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> activates the context state object specified by <em>pState</em>. This means that the device behaviors that are associated with the context state object's feature level and compatible interface are activated on the Direct3D device until the next call to <strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong>. In addition, any state that was saved when this context state object was last active is now reactivated, so that the previous state is replaced.</p><p><strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> sets <em>ppPreviousState</em> to the most recently activated context state object. The object allows the caller to save and then later restore the previous device state. This behavior is useful in a plug-in architecture such as Direct2D that shares a Direct3D device with its plug-ins. A Direct2D interface can use context state objects to save and restore the application's state.</p><p>If the caller did not previously call the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.CreateDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState)"/></strong> method to create a previous context state object, <strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> sets <em>ppPreviousState</em> to the default context state object. In either case, usage of <strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> is the same.</p><p>The feature level that is specified by the application, and that is chosen by the context state object from the acceptable list that the application supplies to <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device1.CreateDeviceContextState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.CreateDeviceContextStateFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Guid,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContextState)"/></strong>, controls the feature level of the immediate context whenever the context state object is active. Because the Direct3D?11 device is free-threaded, the device methods cannot query the current immediate context feature level. Instead, the device runs at a feature level that is the maximum of all previously created context state objects' feature levels. This means that the device's feature level can increase dynamically.</p><p>The feature level of the context state object controls the functionality available from the immediate context. However, to maintain the free-threaded contract of the Direct3D?11 device methods?the resource-creation methods in particular?the upper-bound feature level of all created context state objects controls the set of resources that the device creates.</p><p>Because the context state object interface is published by the immediate context, the interface requires the same threading model as the immediate context. Specifically, <strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> is single-threaded with respect to the other immediate context methods and with respect to the equivalent methods of <strong>ID3D10Device</strong>.</p><p>Crucially, because only one of the Direct3D?10 or Direct3D?11 ref-count behaviors can be available at a time, one of the Direct3D?10 and Direct3D?11 interfaces must break its ref-count contract. To avoid this situation, the activation of a context state object turns off the incompatible version interface. Also, if you call a method of an incompatible version interface, the call silently fails if the method has  return type <strong>void</strong>, returns an <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Result"/></strong> value of <strong>E_INVALIDARG</strong>, or sets any out parameter to <strong><c>null</c></strong>.</p><p>When you switch from Direct3D?11 mode to either Direct3D?10 mode or Direct3D?10.1 mode, the binding behavior of the device changes. Specifically, the final release of a resource induces unbind in Direct3D?10 mode or Direct3D?10.1 mode. During final release an application releases all of the resource's references, including indirect references such as the linkage from view to resource, and the linkage from context state object to any of the context state object's bound resources. Any bound resource to which the application has no reference is unbound and destroyed, in order to maintain the Direct3D?10 behavior.</p><p><strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong> does not affect any state that <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoContext"/></strong> sets. </p><p>Command lists that are generated by deferred contexts do not hold a reference to context state objects and are not affected by future updates to context state objects.</p><p>No asynchronous objects are affected by <strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong>. For example, if a query is active before a call to <strong>SwapDeviceContextState</strong>, it is still active after the call.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p><strong>ClearView</strong> works only on render-target views (RTVs), unordered-access views (UAVs), or any video view of a <strong>Texture2D</strong> surface. The runtime drops invalid calls. Empty rectangles in the <em>pRect</em> array are a no-op. A rectangle is empty if the top value equals the bottom value or the left value equals the right value.</p><p><strong>ClearView</strong> doesn?t support 3D textures.</p><p><strong>ClearView</strong> applies the same color value to all array slices in a view; all rectangles in the <em>pRect</em> array correspond to each array slice.  The <em>pRect</em> array of rectangles is a set of areas to clear on a single surface.  If the view is an array, <strong>ClearView</strong> clears all the rectangles on each array slice individually.</p><p>When you apply rectangles to buffers, set the top value to 0 and the bottom value to 1 and set the left value and right value to describe the extent within the buffer. When the top value equals the bottom value or the left value equals the right value, the rectangle is empty and a no-op is achieved.</p><p>The driver converts and clamps color values to the destination format as appropriate per Direct3D conversion rules.  For example, if the format of the view is <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UNorm"/></strong>, the driver clamps inputs to 0.0f to 1.0f (+INF -&gt; 1.0f (0XFF)/NaN -&gt; 0.0f).</p><p>If the format is integer, such as <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R8G8B8A8_UInt"/></strong>, the runtime interprets inputs as integral floats. Therefore, 235.0f maps to 235 (rounds to zero, out of range/INF values clamp to target range, and NaN to 0).</p><p>Here are the color mappings:</p><ul> <li>Color[0]: R (or Y for video)</li> <li>Color[1]: G (or U/Cb for video)</li> <li>Color[2]: B (or V/Cr for video)</li> <li>Color[3]: A</li> </ul><p>For video views with YUV or YCbBr formats, <strong>ClearView</strong> doesn't convert color values. In situations where the format name doesn?t indicate _UNORM,  _UINT, and so on, <strong>ClearView</strong> assumes _UINT. Therefore, 235.0f maps to 235 (rounds to zero, out of range/INF values clamp to target range, and NaN to 0).</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>In a single call to <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong>, you can map one or more ranges of resource tiles to one or more ranges of tile-pool tiles. </p><p>You can organize the parameters of  <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> in these ways to perform an update:</p><ul> <li><strong>Tiled resource whose mappings are updated.</strong> This is a resource that was created with the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.Tiled"/></strong> flag. Mappings start off all <c>null</c> when a resource is initially created.</li> <li><strong>Set of tile regions on the tiled resource whose mappings are updated.</strong> You can make one <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> call to update many mappings or multiple calls with a bit more API call overhead as well if that is more convenient. <em>NumTiledResourceRegions</em> specifies how many regions there are, <em>pTiledResourceRegionStartCoordinates</em> and <em>pTiledResourceRegionSizes</em> are each arrays that identify the start location and extend of each region. If <em>NumTiledResourceRegions</em> is 1, for convenience either or both of the arrays that describe the regions can be <c>null</c>.  <c>null</c> for <em>pTiledResourceRegionStartCoordinates</em> means the start coordinate is all 0s, and <c>null</c> for <em>pTiledResourceRegionSizes</em> identifies a default region that is the full set of tiles for the entire tiled resource, including all mipmaps, array slices, or both.  <p>If <em>pTiledResourceRegionStartCoordinates</em> isn't <c>null</c> and <em>pTiledResourceRegionSizes</em> is <c>null</c>, the region size defaults to 1 tile for all regions.  This makes it easy to define mappings for a set of individual tiles each at disparate locations by providing an array of locations in <em>pTiledResourceRegionStartCoordinates</em> without having to send an array of <em>pTiledResourceRegionSizes</em> all set to 1.</p> <p>The updates are applied from first region to last; so, if regions overlap in a single call, the updates later in the list overwrite the areas that overlap with previous updates.</p> </li> <li><strong>Tile pool that provides memory where tile mappings can go.</strong> A tiled resource can point to a single tile pool at a time.  If a new tile pool is specified (for the first time or different from the last time a tile pool was specified), all existing tile mappings for the tiled resource are cleared and the new set of mappings in the current <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> call are applied for the new tile pool. If no tile pool is specified (<c>null</c>) or the same tile pool as a previous <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> call is provided, the <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> call just adds the new mappings to existing ones (overwriting on overlap). If <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> only defines <c>null</c> mappings, you don't need to specify a tile pool because it is irrelevant. But if you specify a tile pool anyway, it takes the same behavior as previously described when providing a tile pool. </li> <li><strong>Set of tile ranges where mappings are going.</strong> Each given tile range can specify one of a few types of ranges: a range of tiles in a tile pool (default), a count of tiles in the tiled resource to map to a single tile in a tile pool (sharing the tile), a count of tile mappings in the tiled resource to skip and leave as they are, or a count of tiles in the tile pool to map to <c>null</c>.<p><em>NumRanges</em> specifies the number of tile ranges, where the total tiles identified across all ranges must match the total number of tiles in the tile regions from the previously described tiled resource.  Mappings are defined by iterating through the tiles in the tile regions in sequential order - x then y then z order for box regions - while walking through the set of tile ranges in sequential order.  The breakdown of tile regions doesn't have to line up with the breakdown of tile ranges, but the total number of tiles on both sides must be equal so that each tiled resource tile specified has a mapping specified.</p> <p><em>pRangeFlags</em>, <em>pTilePoolStartOffsets</em>, and <em>pRangeTileCounts</em> are all arrays, of size <em>NumRanges</em>, that describe the tile ranges.  If <em>pRangeFlags</em> is <c>null</c>, all ranges are sequential tiles in the tile pool; otherwise, for each range i, pRangeFlags[i] identifies how the mappings in that range of tiles work:</p> <ul> <li>If pRangeFlags[i] is 0, that range defines sequential tiles in the tile pool, with the number of tiles being pRangeTileCounts[i] and the starting location pTilePoolStartOffsets[i].  If <em>NumRanges</em> is 1, <em>pRangeTileCounts</em> can be <c>null</c> and defaults to the total number of tiles specified by all the tile regions.</li> <li>If pRangeFlags[i] is <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.TileRangeFlags.ReuseSingleTile"/></strong>, pTilePoolStartOffsets[i] identifies the single tile in the tile pool to map to, and pRangeTileCounts[i] specifies how many tiles from the tile regions to map to that tile pool location.  If <em>NumRanges</em> is 1, <em>pRangeTileCounts</em> can be <c>null</c> and defaults to the total number of tiles specified by all the tile regions.</li> <li>If pRangeFlags[i] is <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.TileRangeFlags.Null"/></strong>, pRangeTileCounts[i] specifies how many tiles from the tile regions to map to <c>null</c>.  If <em>NumRanges</em> is 1, <em>pRangeTileCounts</em> can be <c>null</c> and defaults to the total number of tiles specified by all the tile regions. pTilePoolStartOffsets[i] is ignored for <c>null</c> mappings. </li> <li>If pRangeFlags[i] is <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.TileRangeFlags.Skip"/></strong>, pRangeTileCounts[i] specifies how many tiles from the tile regions to skip over and leave existing mappings unchanged for.  This can be useful if a tile region conveniently bounds an area of tile mappings to update except with some exceptions that need to be left the same as whatever they were mapped to before. pTilePoolStartOffsets[i] is ignored for SKIP mappings.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Flags parameter for overall options.</strong> <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.TileMappingFlags.NoOverwrite"/></strong> means the caller promises that previously submitted commands to the device that may still be executing do not reference any of the tile region being updated. This allows the device to avoid having to flush previously submitted work in order to do the tile mapping  update.  If the app violates this promise by updating tile mappings for locations in tiled resources still being referenced by outstanding commands, undefined rendering behavior results, which includes the potential for significant slowdowns on some architectures.  This is like the "no overwrite" concept that exists elsewhere in the Direct3D API, except applied to tile mapping data structure itself, which in hardware is a page table. The absence of this flag requires that tile mapping updates specified by this <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> call must be completed before any subsequent Direct3D command can proceed.</li> </ul><p>If tile mappings have changed on a tiled resource that the app will render via <strong>RenderTargetView</strong> or <strong>DepthStencilView</strong>, the app must clear, by using the fixed function <strong>Clear</strong> APIs, the tiles that have changed within the area being rendered (mapped or not). If an app doesn't clear in these situations, the app receives undefined values when it reads from the tiled resource.  	
            </p><p><strong>Note</strong>??In Direct3D 11.2, hardware can now support <strong>ClearView</strong> on depth-only formats. For more info, see <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.FeatureDataD3D11Options1"/></strong>.</p><p>If an app needs to preserve existing memory contents of areas in a tiled resource where mappings have changed, the app can first save the contents where tile mappings have changed, by copying them to a temporary surface, for example using <strong>CopyTiles</strong>, issuing the required <strong>Clear</strong>, and then copying the contents back.	
            </p><p>Suppose a tile is mapped into multiple tiled resources at the same time and tile contents are manipulated by any means (render, copy, and so on) via one of the tiled resources. Then, if the same tile is to be rendered via any other tiled resource, the tile must be cleared first as previously described.	
            </p><p>Here are some examples of common <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> cases:</p>

            <p><strong>ResizeTilePool</strong> increases or decreases the size of the tile pool depending on whether the app needs more or less working set for the tiled resources that are mapped into it. An app can allocate additional tile pools for new tiled resources, but if any single tiled resource needs more space than initially available in its tile pool, the app can increase the size of the resource's tile pool. A tiled resource can't have mappings into multiple tile pools simultaneously. </p><p>When you increase the size of a tile pool, additional tiles are added to the end of the tile pool via one or more new allocations by the driver; your app can't detect the breakdown into the new allocations. Existing memory in the tile pool is left untouched, and existing tiled resource mappings into that memory remain intact.</p><p>When you decrease the size of a tile pool, tiles are removed from the end (this is allowed even below the initial allocation size, down to 0). This means that new mappings can't be made past the new size. But, existing mappings past the end of the new size remain intact and useable. The memory is kept active as long as mappings to any part of the allocations that are being used for the tile pool memory remains. If after decreasing, some memory has been kept active because tile mappings are pointing to it and the tile pool is increased again (by any amount), the existing memory is reused first before any additional allocations occur to service the size of the increase. </p><p>To be able to save memory, an app has to not only decrease a tile pool but also remove and remap existing mappings past the end of the new smaller tile pool size.</p><p>The act of decreasing (and removing mappings) doesn't necessarily produce immediate memory savings. Freeing of memory depends on how granular the driver's underlying allocations for the tile pool are. When a decrease in the size of a tile pool happens to be enough to make a driver allocation unused, the driver can free the allocation. If a tile pool was increased and if you then decrease to previous sizes (and remove and remap tile mappings correspondingly), you will most likely yield memory savings. But, this scenario isn't guaranteed in the case that the sizes don't exactly align with the underlying allocation sizes chosen by the driver. </p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>Apps can use tiled resources to reuse tiles in different resources. But, a device and driver might not be able to determine whether some memory in a tile pool that was just rendered to is now being used for reading.	
            </p><p>For example, an app can render to some tiles in a tile pool with one tiled resource but then read from the same tiles by using a different tiled resource. These tiled-resource operations are different from using one resource and then just switching from writing with <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RenderTargetView"/></strong> to reading with <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView"/></strong>. The runtime already tracks and handles these one resource operations using <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RenderTargetView"/></strong> and <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView"/></strong>.	
            </p><p>When an app transitions from accessing (reading or writing) some location in a tile pool with one resource to accessing the same memory (read or write) via another tiled resource (with mappings to the same memory), the app must call <strong>TiledResourceBarrier</strong> after the first use of the resource and before the second. The parameters are the <em>pTiledResourceOrViewAccessBeforeBarrier</em> for accesses before the barrier (via rendering, copying), and the <em>pTiledResourceOrViewAccessAfterBarrier</em> for accesses after the barrier by using the same tile pool memory. If the resources are identical, the app doesn't need to call <strong>TiledResourceBarrier</strong> because this kind of hazard is already tracked and handled.	
            </p><p>The barrier call informs the driver that operations issued to the resource before the call must complete before any accesses that occur after the call via a different tiled resource that shares the same memory.	
            </p><p>Either or both of the parameters (before or after the barrier) can be <strong><c>null</c></strong>. <strong><c>null</c></strong> before the barrier means all tiled resource accesses before the barrier must complete before the resource specified after the barrier can be referenced by the graphics processing unit (GPU). <strong><c>null</c></strong> after the barrier means that any tiled resources accessed after the barrier can only be executed by the GPU after accesses to the tiled resources before the barrier are finished. Both <strong><c>null</c></strong> means all previous tiled resource accesses are complete before any subsequent tiled resource access can proceed. 	
            </p><p>An app can pass a view reference, a resource, or <strong><c>null</c></strong> for each parameter. Views are allowed not only for convenience but also to allow the app to scope the barrier effect to a relevant portion of a resource.

            <p>Rasterizer state defines the behavior of the rasterizer stage.

To set rasterizer state, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerStage.SetState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerState)"/></strong>.</p><p>If you do not specify some rasterizer state,  the Direct3D runtime uses the following default values for rasterizer state.</p><table> <tr><th>State</th><th>Default Value</th></tr> <tr><td><strong>FillMode</strong></td><td>Solid</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>CullMode</strong></td><td>Back</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>FrontCounterClockwise</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthBias</strong></td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>SlopeScaledDepthBias</strong></td><td>0.0f</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthBiasClamp</strong></td><td>0.0f</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthClipEnable</strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>ScissorEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>MultisampleEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>ForcedSampleCount</strong></td><td>0</td></tr> </table><p>?</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??For feature levels 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, and 10.0, if you set <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>, the runtime renders all points, lines, and triangles without anti-aliasing even for render targets with a sample count greater than 1. For feature levels 10.1 and higher, the setting of <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> has no effect on points and triangles with regard to MSAA and impacts only the selection of the line-rendering algorithm as shown in this table:</p><p> </p><table> <tr><th>Line-rendering algorithm</th><th><strong>MultisampleEnable</strong></th><th><strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong></th></tr> <tr><td>Aliased</td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Alpha antialiased</td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Quadrilateral</td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Quadrilateral</td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> </table><p>?</p><p>The settings of the <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> and <strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong> members apply only to multisample antialiasing (MSAA) render targets (that is, render targets with sample counts greater than 1). Because of the differences in feature-level behavior and as long as you aren?t performing any line drawing or don?t mind that lines render as quadrilaterals, we recommend that you always set <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> to <strong>TRUE</strong> whenever you render on MSAA render targets.</p>

            <p>Rasterizer state defines the behavior of the rasterizer stage.

To set rasterizer state, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerStage.SetState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerState)"/></strong>.</p><p>If you do not specify some rasterizer state,  the Direct3D runtime uses the following default values for rasterizer state.</p><table> <tr><th>State</th><th>Default Value</th></tr> <tr><td><strong>FillMode</strong></td><td>Solid</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>CullMode</strong></td><td>Back</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>FrontCounterClockwise</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthBias</strong></td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>SlopeScaledDepthBias</strong></td><td>0.0f</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthBiasClamp</strong></td><td>0.0f</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthClipEnable</strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>ScissorEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>MultisampleEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> </table><p>?</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??For feature levels 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, and 10.0, if you set <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>, the runtime renders all points, lines, and triangles without anti-aliasing even for render targets with a sample count greater than 1. For feature levels 10.1 and higher, the setting of <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> has no effect on points and triangles with regard to MSAA and impacts only the selection of the line-rendering algorithm as shown in this table:</p><p> </p><table> <tr><th>Line-rendering algorithm</th><th><strong>MultisampleEnable</strong></th><th><strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong></th></tr> <tr><td>Aliased</td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Alpha antialiased</td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Quadrilateral</td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Quadrilateral</td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> </table><p>?</p><p>The settings of the <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> and <strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong> members apply only to multisample antialiasing (MSAA) render targets (that is, render targets with sample counts greater than 1). Because of the differences in feature-level behavior and as long as you aren?t performing any line drawing or don?t mind that lines render as quadrilaterals, we recommend that you always set <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> to <strong>TRUE</strong> whenever you render on MSAA render targets.</p>

Apps might want to initially run with tiled resource tile mapping validation on; then, when they determine that the calling pattern is safe, they can disable the validation by setting <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DebugFeatureFlags.DisableTiledResourceMappingTrackingAndValidation"/>.</p><p>If <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DebugFeatureFlags.DisableTiledResourceMappingTrackingAndValidation"/> is set when a tiled resource is created, the debug layer never performs the tracking of tile mapping for that resource for its entire lifetime.  Alternatively, if <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DebugFeatureFlags.DisableTiledResourceMappingTrackingAndValidation"/> is set for any given device context method call (like draw or copy calls) involving tiled resources, the debug layer skips all tile mapping validation for the call.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <remarks>	
            Call ID3D10Device::SOSetTargets (before any draw calls) to stream data out; call SOSetTargets with NULL to stop streaming data out. For an example, see Exercise 01 from the GDC 2007 workshop, which sets the stream output render targets before calling draw methods in the RenderInstanceToStream function. An offset of -1 will cause the stream output buffer to be appended, continuing after the last location written to the buffer in a previous stream output pass. Calling this method using a buffer that is currently bound for writing will effectively bind NULL instead because a buffer cannot be bound as both an input and an output at the same time. The {{DeviceDebug Layer}} will generate a warning whenever a resource is prevented from being bound simultaneously as an input and an output, but this will not prevent invalid data from being used by the runtime. The method will not hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. For that reason, applications should be careful not to release an interface currently in use by the device.

            <remarks>	
            Blend state is used by the output-merger stage to determine how to blend together two pixel values. The two values are commonly the current pixel value and the pixel value already in the output render target. Use the blend operation to control where the two pixel values come from and how they are mathematically combined.To create a blend-state interface, call <see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateBlendState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendStateDescription@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.BlendState)"/>.Passing in <c>null</c> for the blend-state interface indicates to the runtime to set a default blending state.  The following table indicates the default blending parameters.StateDefault Value AlphaToCoverageEnableFALSE BlendEnableFALSE[8] SrcBlendD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD SrcBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ONE DstBlendAlphaD3D11_BLEND_ZERO BlendOpAlphaD3D11_BLEND_OP_ADD RenderTargetWriteMask[8]<see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ColorWriteMaskFlags.All"/>[8]?A sample mask determines which samples get updated in all the active render targets. The mapping of bits in a sample mask to samples in a multisample render target is the responsibility of an individual application. A sample mask is always applied; it is independent of whether multisampling is enabled, and does not depend on whether an application uses multisample render targets.The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10.

            <p>The maximum number of active render targets a device can have active at any given time is set by a #define in D3D11.h called  <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.OutputMergerStage.SimultaneousRenderTargetCount"/></strong>. It is invalid to try to set the same subresource to multiple render target slots.  Any render targets not defined by this call are set to <strong><c>null</c></strong>.</p><p>If any subresources are also currently bound for reading in a different stage or writing (perhaps in a different part of the pipeline),  those bind points will be set to <strong><c>null</c></strong>, in order to prevent the same subresource from being read and written simultaneously in a single rendering operation.</p><p> The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in. This differs from the device state behavior in Direct3D 10. </p><p>If the render-target views were created from an array resource type, all of the render-target views must have the same array size.   This restriction also applies to the depth-stencil view, its array size must match that of the render-target views being bound.</p><p>The pixel shader must be able to simultaneously render to at least eight separate render targets. All of these render targets must access the same type of resource: Buffer, Texture1D, Texture1DArray, Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, or TextureCube. All render targets must have the same size in all dimensions (width and height, and depth for 3D or array size for *Array types). If render targets use multisample anti-aliasing, all bound render targets and depth buffer must be the same form of multisample resource (that is, the sample counts must be the same). Each render target can have a different data format. These render target formats are not required to have identical bit-per-element counts.</p><p>Any combination of the eight slots for render targets can have a render target set or not set.</p><p>The same resource view cannot be bound to multiple render target slots simultaneously. However, you can set multiple non-overlapping resource views of a single resource as simultaneous multiple render targets.</p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

A shader-resource buffer is created with the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.ShaderResource"/> flag and is bound to the pipeline using one of these APIs: <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.GeometryShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong>, <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.PixelShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong>, or <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VertexShaderStage.SetShaderResources(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.IntPtr)"/></strong>. Furthermore, a shader-resource buffer cannot use the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/></strong> flag.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows?8, enables  mapping dynamic constant buffers and shader resource views (SRVs) of dynamic buffers with <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.MapMode.WriteNoOverwrite"/></strong>.  The Direct3D 11 and earlier runtimes limited mapping to vertex or index buffers. To determine if a Direct3D device supports these features, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CheckFeatureSupport(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Feature)"/></strong> with <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Feature.D3D11Options"/></strong>. <strong>CheckFeatureSupport</strong> fills members of a <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.FeatureDataD3D11Options"/></strong> structure with the device's features.

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>The runtime implements RGB blending and alpha blending separately. Therefore, blend state requires separate blend operations for RGB data and alpha data. These blend operations are specified in a <strong>blend description</strong>. The two sources ?source 1 and source 2? are shown in the blending block diagram.</p><p>Blend state is used by the output-merger stage to determine how to blend together two RGB pixel values and two alpha values. The two RGB pixel values and two alpha values are the RGB pixel value and alpha value that the pixel shader outputs and the RGB pixel value and alpha value already in the output render target. The <strong>blend option</strong> controls the data source that the blending stage uses to modulate values for the pixel shader, render target, or both. The <strong>blend operation</strong> controls how the blending stage mathematically combines these modulated values.</p>

You can set this flag in your app, typically in release builds only, to prevent end users from using the DirectX Control Panel to monitor how the app uses Direct3D.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>??You can also set this flag in your app to prevent Direct3D debugging tools, such as Visual Studio Ultimate?2012, from hooking your app.</p> <p><strong>Windows?8.1:??</strong>This flag doesn't prevent Visual Studio?2013 and later running on Windows?8.1 and later from hooking your app; instead use <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext2.IsAnnotationEnabled_"/></strong>. This flag still prevents Visual Studio?2013 and later running on Windows?8 and earlier from hooking your app. </p> <p><strong>Direct3D 11:??</strong>This value is not supported until Direct3D 11.1.</p> </dd>

If this flag is not set, the operating system performs timeout detection and recovery when it detects a GPU packet that took more than two seconds to execute. If this flag is set, the operating system allows such a long running packet to execute without resetting the GPU. We recommend not to set this flag if your device needs to be highly responsive so that the operating system can detect and recover from GPU timeouts.

            <dd> <p>Forces the creation of the Direct3D device to fail if the display driver is not implemented to the WDDM for Windows?8 (WDDM 1.2). When the display driver is not implemented to WDDM 1.2, only a Direct3D device that is created with feature level 9.1, 9.2, or 9.3 supports video; therefore, if this flag is set, the runtime creates the Direct3D device only for feature level 9.1, 9.2, or 9.3. We recommend not to specify this flag for applications that want to favor Direct3D capability over video. If feature level 10 and higher is available, the runtime will use that feature level regardless of video support.</p> <p>If this flag is set, device creation on the Basic Render Device (BRD) will succeed regardless of the BRD's missing support for video decode. This is because the Media Foundation video stack operates in software mode on BRD. In this situation, if you force the video stack to create the Direct3D device twice (create the device once with this flag, next discover BRD, then again create the device without the flag), you actually degrade performance.</p> <p>If you attempt to create a Direct3D device with driver type <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Null"/></strong>, <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Reference"/></strong>, or <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType.Software"/></strong>, device creation fails at any feature level because none of the associated drivers provide video capability.

            <remarks>	
            <p><strong>Note</strong>??If you use different filter types for min versus mag filter, undefined behavior occurs in certain cases where the choice between whether magnification or minification happens is ambiguous.  To prevent this undefined behavior, use filter modes that use similar filter operations for both min and mag (or use anisotropic filtering, which avoids the issue as well).</p><p>During texture sampling, one or more texels are read and combined (this is calling filtering) to produce a single value. Point sampling reads a single texel while linear sampling reads two texels (endpoints) and linearly interpolates a third value between the endpoints.</p><p>HLSL texture-sampling functions also support comparison filtering during texture sampling. Comparison filtering compares each sampled texel against a comparison value. The boolean result is blended the same way that normal texture filtering is blended.</p><p>You can use HLSL intrinsic texture-sampling functions that implement texture filtering only or companion functions that use texture filtering with comparison filtering.</p><table> <tr><th>Texture Sampling Function</th><th>Texture Sampling Function with Comparison Filtering</th></tr> <tr><td>sample</td><td>samplecmp or samplecmplevelzero</td></tr> </table><p>?</p><p>Comparison filters only work with textures that have the following DXGI formats: R32_FLOAT_X8X24_TYPELESS, R32_FLOAT, R24_UNORM_X8_TYPELESS, R16_UNORM.</p>

You must set the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/></strong> flag  on surfaces that you use with GDI. Setting the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/></strong> flag allows GDI rendering on the surface via <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.DXGI.Surface1.GetDC(SharpDX.Mathematics.Interop.RawBool)"/></strong>.

Therefore, do not use them together.</li> <li><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.ResourceClamp"/> and <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.GdiCompatible"/> are mutually exclusive. Therefore, do not use them together.</li> <li>You must bind the texture as a render target for the output-merger stage. For example, set the <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.BindFlags.RenderTarget"/> flag in the <strong>BindFlags</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/></strong> structure.</li> <li>You must set the maximum number of MIP map levels to 1. For example, set the <strong>MipLevels</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/></strong> structure to 1.</li> <li>You must specify that the texture requires read and write access by the GPU. For example, set the <strong>Usage</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription"/></strong> structure to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ResourceUsage.Default"/>.</li> <li> <p>You must set the texture format to one of the following types. </p> <ul> <li><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/>

Therefore, set the <strong>Count</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.DXGI.SampleDescription"/></strong> structure to 1.

            <p>An app calls <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CheckMultisampleQualityLevels(SharpDX.DXGI.Format,System.Int32)"/></strong> to get the number of quality levels available during multisampling. A 0 quality level means the hardware does not support multisampling for the particular format. If the number of quality levels is greater than 0 and the hardware supports the fixed sample patterns for the sample count, the app can request the fixed patterns by specifying quality level as either <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.StandardMultisampleQualityLevels.StandardMultisamplePattern"/></strong> or <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.StandardMultisampleQualityLevels.CenterMultisamplePattern"/></strong>. The app can call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CheckFormatSupport(SharpDX.DXGI.Format)"/></strong> to check for support of the standard fixed patterns. If the hardware only supports the fixed patterns but no additional vendor-specific patterns, the runtime can report the number of quality levels as 1, and the hardware can pretend 0 quality level behaves the same as quality level equal to <see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.StandardMultisampleQualityLevels.StandardMultisamplePattern"/>.</p><p>The runtime defines the following standard sample patterns for 1(trivial),  2, 4, 8, and 16 sample counts. Hardware must support 1, 4, and 8 sample counts. Hardware vendors can expose more sample counts beyond these. However, if vendors support 2, 4(required), 8(required), or 16, they must also support the corresponding standard pattern or center pattern for each of those sample counts.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

A 16-bit interleave pattern defines the conversion from pre-swizzled intra-page location to the post-swizzled location.  </p><p>To demonstrate, consider the 32bpp swizzle format above.  This is represented by the following interleave masks, where bits on the left are most-significant.</p><code>UINT xBytesMask = 1010 1010 1000 1111

            </code><p>To compute the swizzled address, the following code could be used (where the _pdep_u32 instruction is supported):</p><code>UINT swizzledOffset = resourceBaseOffset + _pdep_u32(xOffset, xBytesMask) +  _pdep_u32(yOffset, yBytesMask);

            <remarks>	
            <p>These flags define video processing capabilities that usually are not needed, and that video devices are therefore not required to support.</p><p> The first three flags relate to RGB support for functions that are normally applied to YCbCr video: deinterlacing, color adjustment, and luma keying. A device that supports these functions for YCbCr is not required  to support them for RGB input. Supporting RGB input for these functions  is  an additional capability, reflected by these constants. Note that the driver might convert the input to another color space, perform the indicated function, and then convert the result back to RGB. </p><p>Similarly, a device that supports deinterlacing is not required to support deinterlacing of palettized formats. This capability is indicated by the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorFormatCaps.PaletteInterlaced"/></strong> flag.</p>

            <p>This enumeration designates the two stereo views as "frame 0" and "frame 1". The <em>LeftViewFrame0</em> parameter of the <strong>VideoProcessorSetStreamStereoFormat</strong> method specifies which view is the left view, and which is the right view.</p><p>For packed formats, if the source rectangle clips part of the surface, the driver interprets the rectangle in logical coordinates relative to the stereo view,  rather than absolute pixel coordinates. The result is that frame 0 and frame 1 are clipped proportionately.</p><p>To query whether the device supports stereo 3D video, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorEnumerator.GetVideoProcessorCaps(SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorCaps@)"/></strong> and check for the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorFeatureCaps.Stereo"/></strong> flag in the <strong>FeatureCaps</strong> member of the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorCaps"/></strong> structure. If this capability flag is present, it means that the driver supports all of the stereo formats that are not  listed as optional. To find out which optional formats are supported, call <strong>GetVideoProcessorCaps</strong> and check the <strong>StereoCaps</strong> member of the structure.</p>

Before using a geometry shader you must bind it to the device by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.GeometryShaderStage.SetShader(SharpDX.Direct3D11.GeometryShader,SharpDX.Direct3D11.ClassInstance[],System.Int32)"/></strong>.</p><p>This interface is defined in D3D11.h.</p>

            <p> The method will hold a reference to the interfaces passed in.

But you can use <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer"/></strong> to get information from a compiled shader. For example, you can use <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer"/></strong> and <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflectionVariable"/></strong> to determine the slot in which a geometry shader expects a constant buffer. You can then pass this slot number to <strong>GSSetConstantBuffers</strong> to set the constant buffer. You can call the <strong>D3D11Reflect</strong> function to retrieve the address of a reference to the <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflection"/></strong> interface and then call <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ShaderReflection.GetConstantBuffer"/></strong> to get a reference to <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.ConstantBuffer"/></strong>.</p><p>The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available starting with Windows?8, can bind a larger number of <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Buffer"/></strong> resources to the shader than the maximum constant buffer size that is supported by shaders (4096 constants ? 4*32-bit components each).  When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.  </p><p>If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the <strong>GSSetConstantBuffers1</strong> method instead. </p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

When you bind such a large buffer, the shader can access only the first 4096 4*32-bit component constants in the buffer, as if 4096 constants is the full size of the buffer.  </p><p>If the application wants the shader to access other parts of the buffer, it must call the <strong>HSSetConstantBuffers1</strong> method instead. </p><p><strong>Windows?Phone?8:</strong> This API is supported.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>A view is a format-specific way to look at the data in a resource. The view determines what data to look at, and how it is cast when read.</p><p>When viewing a resource, the resource-view description must specify a typed format, that is compatible with the resource format. So that means that you cannot create a resource-view description using any format with _TYPELESS in the name. You can however view a typeless resource by specifying a typed format for the view. For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless"/> resource can be viewed with one of these typed formats: <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt"/>, and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_SInt"/>, since these typed formats are compatible with the typeless resource.</p><p>Create a shader-resource-view description by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateShaderResourceView(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription},SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView)"/></strong>. To view a shader-resource-view description, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription@)"/></strong>.</p>

            <summary>	
            <p>The <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.UserDefinedAnnotation"/></strong> interface enables an application to describe conceptual sections and markers within the application's code flow. An appropriately enabled tool, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate?2012, can display these sections and markers visually along the tool's Microsoft Direct3D time line, while the tool debugs the application. These visual notes allow users of such a tool to navigate to parts of the time line that are of interest, or to understand what set of Direct3D calls are produced by certain sections of the application's code.</p>	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>The methods of <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.UserDefinedAnnotation"/></strong> have no effect when the calling application is not running under a Direct3D-specific profiling tool like Visual Studio Ultimate?2012.	
            </p><p>The <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.UserDefinedAnnotation"/></strong> interface is published by Microsoft Direct3D?11 device contexts. Therefore, <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.UserDefinedAnnotation"/></strong> has the same threading rules as the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext"/></strong> interface, or any other context interface. For more information about Direct3D threading, see MultiThreading.	
            To retrieve the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.UserDefinedAnnotation"/></strong> interface for the context, call the <strong>QueryInterface</strong> method for the context (for example, <strong>ID3D11DeviceContext::QueryInterface</strong>). In this call, you must pass the identifier of <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.UserDefinedAnnotation"/></strong>. </p><p>The <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.UserDefinedAnnotation"/></strong> interface is the Microsoft Direct3D?10 and later equivalent of the Direct3D 9 PIX functions (D3DPERF_* functions).</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??Setting the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags.PreventAlteringLayerSettingsFromRegistry"/></strong> flag in your app replaces calling D3DPerf_SetOptions(1). But, to prevent Direct3D debugging tools from hooking your app, your app can also call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.UserDefinedAnnotation.GetStatus"/></strong> to determine whether it is running under a Direct3D debugging tool and then exit accordingly.</p><p>You must call the <strong>BeginEvent</strong> and <strong>EndEvent</strong> methods in pairs; pairs of calls to these methods can nest within pairs of calls to these methods at a higher level in the application's call stack.  In other words, a "Draw World" section can entirely contain another section named "Draw Trees," which can in turn entirely contain a section called "Draw Oaks." You can only associate an <strong>EndEvent</strong> method with the most recent <strong>BeginEvent</strong> method, that is, pairs cannot overlap. You cannot call an <strong>EndEvent</strong> for any <strong>BeginEvent</strong> that preceded the most recent <strong>BeginEvent</strong>. In fact, the runtime interprets the first <strong>EndEvent</strong> as ending the second <strong>BeginEvent</strong>.</p>

            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>Shadows are an important element in realistic 3D scenes.  You can use the shadow buffer technique to render shadows.  The basic principle of the technique is to use a depth buffer to store the scene depth info from the perspective of the light source, and then compare each point rendered in the scene with that buffer to determine if it is in shadow.</p><p>To render objects into the scene with shadows on them, you create <strong>sampler state objects</strong> with comparison filtering set and  the comparison mode (ComparisonFunc) to LessEqual.  You can also set BorderColor addressing on this depth sampler, even though BorderColor isn't typically allowed on feature levels 9.1 and 9.2.  By using the border color and picking 0.0 or 1.0 as the border color value, you can control whether the regions off the edge of the shadow map appear to be always in shadow or never in shadow respectively.	
            You can control the shadow filter quality by the Mag and Min filter settings in the comparison sampler.  Point sampling will produce shadows with non-anti-aliased edges.  Linear filter sampler settings will result in higher quality shadow edges, but might affect performance on some power-optimized devices.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??If you use a separate setting for Mag versus Min filter options, you produce an undefined result.  Anisotropic filtering is not supported. The Mip filter choice is not relevant because feature level 9.x does not allow mipmapped depth buffers.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??On feature level 9.x, you can't compile a shader with the <strong>SampleCmp</strong> and <strong>SampleCmpLevelZero</strong> intrinsic functions by using older versions of the compiler. For example,  you can't use the fxc.exe compiler that ships with the DirectX SDK or use the <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.D3D.Compile"/>**</strong> functions (like <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.D3D.CompileFromFile"/></strong>) that are implemented in D3DCompiler_43.dll and earlier. These intrinsic functions on feature level 9.x are only supported in the fxc.exe compiler that ships with the Windows?8 SDK and later and with the <strong><see cref="!:SharpDX.D3DCompiler.D3D.Compile"/>**</strong> functions that are implemented in D3DCompiler_44.dll and later.	
            But these intrinsic functions are present in shader models for feature levels higher than 9.x.</p>

            <p>Rasterizer state defines the behavior of the rasterizer stage. To create a rasterizer-state object, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateRasterizerState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerStateDescription@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerState)"/></strong>. To set rasterizer state, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerStage.SetState(SharpDX.Direct3D11.RasterizerState)"/></strong>.</p><p>If you do not specify some rasterizer state,  the Direct3D runtime uses the following default values for rasterizer state.</p><table> <tr><th>State</th><th>Default Value</th></tr> <tr><td><strong>FillMode</strong></td><td>Solid</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>CullMode</strong></td><td>Back</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>FrontCounterClockwise</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthBias</strong></td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>SlopeScaledDepthBias</strong></td><td>0.0f</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthBiasClamp</strong></td><td>0.0f</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>DepthClipEnable</strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>ScissorEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>MultisampleEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td><strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> </table><p>?</p><strong>Note</strong>??For feature levels 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, and 10.0, if you set <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> to <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong>, the runtime renders all points, lines, and triangles without anti-aliasing even for render targets with a sample count greater than 1. For feature levels 10.1 and higher, the setting of <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> has no effect on points and triangles with regard to MSAA and impacts only the selection of the line-rendering algorithm as shown in this table:?<p> </p><table> <tr><th>Line-rendering algorithm</th><th><strong>MultisampleEnable</strong></th><th><strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong></th></tr> <tr><td>Aliased</td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Alpha antialiased</td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Quadrilateral</td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td><td><strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Result.False"/></strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Quadrilateral</td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td><td><strong>TRUE</strong></td></tr> </table><p>?</p><p>The settings of the <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> and <strong>AntialiasedLineEnable</strong> members apply only to multisample antialiasing (MSAA) render targets (that is, render targets with sample counts greater than 1). Because of the differences in feature-level behavior and as long as you aren?t performing any line drawing or don?t mind that lines render as quadrilaterals, we recommend that you always set <strong>MultisampleEnable</strong> to <strong>TRUE</strong> whenever you render on MSAA render targets.</p>

            <p>The following diagram shows a 3D box, where the origin is the left, front, top corner.</p><p></p><p>The values for <strong>right</strong>, <strong>bottom</strong>, and <strong>back</strong> are each one pixel past the end of the pixels that are included in the box region.  That is, the values for <strong>left</strong>, <strong>top</strong>, and <strong>front</strong> are included in the box region while the values for right, bottom, and back are excluded from the box region. For example, for a box that is one pixel wide, (right - left) == 1; the box region includes the left pixel but not the right pixel.</p><p>Coordinates of a box are in bytes for buffers and in texels for textures.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>A view is a format-specific way to look at the data in a resource. The view determines what data to look at, and how it is cast when read.</p><p>When viewing a resource, the resource-view description must specify a typed format, that is compatible with the resource format. So that means that you cannot create a resource-view description using any format with _TYPELESS in the name. You can however view a typeless resource by specifying a typed format for the view. For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless"/> resource can be viewed with one of these typed formats: <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt"/>, and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_SInt"/>, since these typed formats are compatible with the typeless resource.</p><p>Create a shader-resource-view description by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateShaderResourceView(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription},SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView)"/></strong>. To view a shader-resource-view description, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription@)"/></strong>.</p>

            <remarks>	
            <p>A view is a format-specific way to look at the data in a resource. The view determines what data to look at, and how it is cast when read.</p><p>When viewing a resource, the resource-view description must specify a typed format, that is compatible with the resource format. So that means that you cannot create a resource-view description using any format with _TYPELESS in the name. You can however view a typeless resource by specifying a typed format for the view. For example, a <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Typeless"/> resource can be viewed with one of these typed formats: <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_Float"/>, <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_UInt"/>, and <see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32_SInt"/>, since these typed formats are compatible with the typeless resource.</p><p>Create a shader-resource-view description by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateShaderResourceView(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Resource,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription},SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView)"/></strong>. To view a shader-resource-view description, call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceView.GetDescription(SharpDX.Direct3D11.ShaderResourceViewDescription@)"/></strong>.</p>

            <p>This structure is used in a call to <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D(SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2DDescription@,SharpDX.DataBox[],SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2D)"/></strong>.</p><p>In addition to this structure, you can also use the <strong>CD3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC</strong> derived structure, which is defined  in D3D11.h and behaves like an inherited class, to help create a texture description.</p><p>The device places some size restrictions (must be multiples of a minimum size) for a subsampled, block compressed, or bit-format resource.</p><p>The texture size range is determined by the feature level at which you create the device and not the Microsoft Direct3D interface version. For example, if you use Microsoft Direct3D?10 hardware at feature level 10 (<strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel.Level_10_0"/></strong>) and call <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3D11.CreateDevice(SharpDX.DXGI.Adapter,SharpDX.Direct3D.DriverType,System.IntPtr,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceCreationFlags,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel[],System.Int32,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D.FeatureLevel@,SharpDX.Direct3D11.DeviceContext@)"/></strong> to create an <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device"/></strong>, you must constrain the maximum texture size to D3D10_REQ_TEXTURE2D_U_OR_V_DIMENSION (8192) when you create your 2D texture.</p>

            <p>Texels are equivalent to pixels.  For untyped buffer resources, a texel is just a byte. For multisample antialiasing (MSAA) surfaces, the numbers are still in terms of pixels/texels.	
            The values here are independent of the surface dimensions.  Even if the surface is smaller than what would fit in a tile, the full tile dimensions are reported here.

            <p>The <strong>RGB_Range</strong> member applies to RGB output, while the <strong>YCbCr_Matrix</strong> and <strong>YCbCr_xvYCC</strong> members apply to YCbCr output. If the driver performs color-space conversion on the background color, it uses the values that apply to both color spaces. </p><p>If the driver supports extended YCbCr (xvYCC), it returns the <strong><see cref="F:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorDeviceCaps.XvYCC"/></strong> capabilities flag in the <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorEnumerator.GetVideoProcessorCaps(SharpDX.Direct3D11.VideoProcessorCaps@)"/></strong> method. Otherwise, the driver ignores the value of <strong>YCbCr_xvYCC</strong> and treats all YCbCr output as conventional YCbCr. </p><p>If extended YCbCr is supported, it can be used with either transfer matrix. Extended YCbCr does not change the black point or white point?the black point is still 16 and the white point is still 235. However, extended YCbCr explicitly allows blacker-than-black values in the range 1?15, and whiter-than-white values in the range 236?254. When extended YCbCr is used, the driver should not clip the luma values to the nominal 16?235 range.</p>
