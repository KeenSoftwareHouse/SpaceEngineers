            This method performs a ray vs ray intersection test based on the following formula
            from Goldman.
            <code>s = det([o_2 - o_1, d_2, d_1 x d_2]) / ||d_1 x d_2||^2</code>
            <code>t = det([o_2 - o_1, d_1, d_1 x d_2]) / ||d_1 x d_2||^2</code>
            Where o_1 is the position of the first ray, o_2 is the position of the second ray,
            d_1 is the normalized direction of the first ray, d_2 is the normalized direction
            of the second ray, det denotes the determinant of a matrix, x denotes the cross
            product, [ ] denotes a matrix, and || || denotes the length or magnitude of a vector.

            <remarks>
            This method tests if the ray intersects either the front or back of the triangle.
            If the ray is parallel to the triangle's plane, no intersection is assumed to have
            happened. If the intersection of the ray and the triangle is behind the origin of
            the ray, no intersection is assumed to have happened. In both cases of assumptions,
            this method returns false.

            <remarks>Distance squared is the value before taking the square root. 
            Distance squared can often be used in place of distance if relative comparisons are being made. 
            For example, consider three points A, B, and C. To determine whether B or C is further from A, 
            compare the distance between A and B to the distance between A and C. Calculating the two distances 
            involves two square roots, which are computationally expensive. However, using distance squared 
            provides the same information and avoids calculating two square roots.

            A coordinate transform performs the transformation with the assumption that the w component

            component in the vector divided by the w component. This forces the w component to be one and
            therefore makes the vector homogeneous. The homogeneous vector is often preferred when working
            with coordinates as the w component can safely be ignored.

            <remarks>Distance squared is the value before taking the square root. 
            Distance squared can often be used in place of distance if relative comparisons are being made. 
            For example, consider three points A, B, and C. To determine whether B or C is further from A, 
            compare the distance between A and B to the distance between A and C. Calculating the two distances 
            involves two square roots, which are computationally expensive. However, using distance squared 
            provides the same information and avoids calculating two square roots.

            <remarks>Distance squared is the value before taking the square root. 
            Distance squared can often be used in place of distance if relative comparisons are being made. 
            For example, consider three points A, B, and C. To determine whether B or C is further from A, 
            compare the distance between A and B to the distance between A and C. Calculating the two distances 
            involves two square roots, which are computationally expensive. However, using distance squared 
            provides the same information and avoids calculating two square roots.
