            <p>An <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect"/></strong> interface manages a set of state objects, resources, and shaders for implementing a rendering effect.</p>	
            </summary>	
            <remarks>	
            <p>An effect is created by calling <strong><see cref="M:SharpDX.Direct3D11.D3DX11Effects.CreateEffectFromMemory(System.IntPtr,SharpDX.PointerSize,System.Int32,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device,SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect)"/></strong>.</p><p>The effect system groups the information required for rendering into an effect which contains:  state objects for assigning state changes in groups, resources for supplying input data and storing output data,  and programs that control how the rendering is done called shaders.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??The DirectX SDK does not supply any compiled binaries for effects. You must use Effects 11 source to build  your effects-type application. For more information about using Effects 11 source, see Differences Between Effects 10 and Effects 11.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>??</p><p>If you call <strong>QueryInterface</strong> on an <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.Direct3D11.Effect"/></strong> object to retrieve the <strong><see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/></strong> interface, <strong>QueryInterface</strong> returns E_NOINTERFACE. To work around this issue, use the following code:</p><pre> <see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/>* pIUnknown = (<see cref="T:SharpDX.ComObject"/>*)pEffect; pIUnknown-&gt;AddRef();
